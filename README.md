# Project2
This project is used to build top-k monitoring system in IoT. In our system, there are a lot of groups. Each group has the same  kind of sensors. On the fog layer, there are some nodes. Each node collects data from a kind of sensor. On cloud layer, we have to collect all data and process them. We have to find out the k groups having best total value .
